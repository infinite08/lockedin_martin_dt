This repository contains our team's submissions for the HAL Aerothon 2025.

We chose the first track, ie., Digital Twin implementation of a helicopter fuel injection system.


This repository contains three parts - 
* The OpenModelica simulation
* Arduino based data capture
* Streamlit based web interface
